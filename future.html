          <h2>Future Goals</h2>
          <p>
            I have my academic goals, but I also have general goals for the
            future. Once I get my career in order, I want to leave the city.
            I've lived in Los Angeles my whole life, and I've gotten tired of
            urban life. In the future, I'd like to go back and visit my
            birthplace in North Carolina. Maybe in the far future I'll live in
            Alaska. It seems like a quiet place I might like. I'd also like to
            travel, but my biggest goal is to get to a point where I can be at
            peace. I'm tired of being unsure and stressed about everything.

          <h2>Memorable Quotes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              “Your greatest dreams are all on the other side of the wall of
              fear and caution.”
            </li>
            <li>
              "There is a fatality about good resolutions -- that they are
              always made too late."
            </li>
            <li>
              "There is a luxury in self reproach. It is the confession, not the
              priest, that gives us absolution."
            </li>
            <li>"To be good is to be in harmony with one's self."</li>
